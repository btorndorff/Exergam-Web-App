Hello! This our documentation for our project Exergam!

The first thing you will want to do is to log in with your Google Account.

After logging in, please follow the instructions on screen to set up your profile. 

After updating your profile, feel free to explore the features of our website. Some notable features include searching, leaderboard, adding an exercise, and adding a post.

Try searching for a user! Since you probably don't know anyone on the app yet, try opening up the leaderboard and clicking on someone's username!

Or, you could search for Josh Jeon in the search bar. Try following whoever you'd like.

Take a look at our Google Maps API by creating a post! The link to create a post is under the "+" sign image on the top right-hand side.

Try adding exercises (also under the "+" sign). You'll also see your rank and progress on your profile (click on your profile picture).

After that, try messing around, adding comments on peoples' posts and following new people! We hope you have fun working with our app!

** Extra comment
For our settings.py file, we had to put DEBUG=True instead of False since setting it to false gave us a server error (500). Hosting uploaded files onto Heroku would wipe them after a period of time, so we thought the best thing to do is to leave debugging as true.
